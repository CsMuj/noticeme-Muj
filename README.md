# Creating “reminder” alarms for students on iOS using swift, swiftUI, swiftdata and various external app apis to gather data

Aspects:
– widgets(multiple designs?)
– accessing/analyzing data (GC, Deltamath, VHL…; scan documents, take pictures of flyers, take pictures of slides;)
– UI/generating outputs (title, due date, notes)
– generating reminders (Info added to google calendar or notion calendar; AI determines frequency/specific tactics ex. Remove social media apps for X time)
-Contextualization on the data present
